So far all model experiments have been exclusively trained with the \textit{binary cross-entropy} loss function as given in equation~\eqref{eq:binary-cross-entropy}.
While this is the dominant loss function for binary classification tasks, it is still considered a suboptimal surrogate loss function for segmentation evaluation metrics such as the IoU metric.
Alternative loss functions were discussed in~\secref{sec:segmentation-metrics}, the so-called soft loss variants being of greatest interest.
Specifically, the \textit{soft Jaccard loss} given in equation~\eqref{eq:soft-jaccard-loss} and \textit{soft dice loss} given in equation~\eqref{eq:soft-dice-loss} having been theoretically and empirically shown to be efficient surrogate loss functions for the IoU metric.
Three models have been trained and evaluated, the only difference being which loss function that was used during training; binary cross-entropy, soft Jaccard loss, or soft dice loss.
The training procedures of these three models are visualized in \figref{fig:losses-training}.

The three models presented in~\figref{fig:losses-training} start out at approximately the same point after one epoch, but the binary cross-entropy model quickly outperforms the two other models when it comes to mean validation IoU.
The soft losses seem to be \emph{worse} surrogate losses for the IoU metric rather than better ones, completely contradicting our prior beliefs.
