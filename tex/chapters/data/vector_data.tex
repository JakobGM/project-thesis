A \textit{line string} is an ordered collection of geographic points $(\vec{p}_0, \ldots, \vec{p}_n)$ defining a path which connects each consecutive point by a straight line.
The points are therefore necessarily order dependent.
A \textit{simple} line string is a path which does \textit{not} intersect itself, while a \textit{complex} line string is one that does.
When the first and last points of a line string are identical it is considered a \textit{linear ring}, i.e.\ $l = (\vec{p}_0, \ldots, \vec{p}_n, \vec{p}_0)$.
A \textit{polygon} can therefore be represented by a simple linear ring which defines its \textit{exterior hull} and any number of simple linear strings which defines its \textit{interior hulls}.
\figref{fig:polygon-representation} illustrates these concepts for polygons with and without interior hulls. % chktex 2

A polygon is considered invalid if one or more of its linear rings are self-intersecting, i.e.\ if any of its rings is considered to be complex.
Data providers frequently provide polygons in invalid states and such polygons must be corrected since they are often not processable by common GIS tools.
Zero-buffering invalid polygons (growing the polygon in all directions by zero units) fixes such problems, as can be seen in~\figref{fig:complex-zero-buffer}.

Zero-buffering polygons has the added benefit of normalizing vector data by re-ordering the polygon vertices in an anti-clockwise manner and removing redundant vertices as shown in~\figref{fig:redundant-zero-buffer}.

  \input{tikz/unnecessary_vertices.tex}

This allows you to apply simpler similarity measures for comparing polygons, and reduces computational costs when processing the polygons.
Technical details for applying zero-buffers to vector data is provided in~\appref{app:zero-buffer}.
We will come back to how to combine vector and raster datasets by \textit{rasterization} in~\secref{sec:masking} where it will also become clear why the removal of redundant vertices is of importance.
