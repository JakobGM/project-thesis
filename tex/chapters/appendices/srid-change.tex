\texttt{GDAL} provides the \texttt{gdaltransform} utility for transforming GIS data between coordinate systems, for example converting from GPS to UTM \texttt{32V} here:

\begin{shellcode}
$ gdaltransform \
    -s_srs EPSG:4236 \
    -t_srs EPSG:25832 \
    ${source_data} ${target}
\end{shellcode}

Where \texttt{\$} indicates a shell, such as \texttt{bash}, where \texttt{GDAL} has been installed and is available in the \texttt{PATH}.
