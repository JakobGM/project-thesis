\secref{sec:data-types} discusses irregular vector data and how such vector features can be corrected by applying a zero buffer.
The \texttt{ST\_buffer()} PostGIS function can be applied to arbitrary geometric data with the \texttt{ogr2ogr} utility like so:

\begin{shellcode}
$ ogr2ogr -f "GPKG" ${output_file} ${input_file} \
    -sql "select ST_buffer(Geometry, 0.0)"
\end{shellcode}

Here we have also converted the given vector data file to the \textit{GeoPackage} format.
While geographic data providers use a wide array of file formats, most commonly GeoJSON, ESRI Shapefiles, and GML, we convert all files to the modern GeoPackage format.
GeoPackage supports unicode characters and has no length limit on data fields, and is therefore considered the best format for modern GIS pipelines~\cite{hame_shapefile_2019}.
\texttt{ogr2ogr} supports file conversions between most common vector file formats, which makes the data pipeline generalizable data sourced from different providers.
