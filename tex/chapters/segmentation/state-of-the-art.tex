  \item Deep learning image segmentation overview given here~\cite{segmentation-overview} (\citeyear{segmentation-overview}).
  \item Recent semantic segmentation progress described here~\cite{segmentation-progress} (\citeyear{segmentation-progress}).
  \item Use of fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation described here~\cite{segmentation-fcnn} (\citeyear{segmentation-fcnn}).
  \item SegNet architecture described here~\cite{segmentation-segnet} (\citeyear{segmentation-segnet}).
  \item U-Net architecture described here~\cite{segmentation-unet} (\citeyear{segmentation-unet}).
  \item Mask R-CNN architecture described here~\cite{segmentation-mask-r-cnn} (\citeyear{segmentation-mask-r-cnn}).
