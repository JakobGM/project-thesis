The field of \textit{computer vision} got started in the early 1970s~\cite[p.~10]{computer_vision_history}.
Computer vision differs from the classical discipline of \textit{digital image processing} by concerning itself with the three-dimensional reconstruction of a scene from two-dimensional data~\cite[p.~10]{computer_vision_history}.
Most of the early research in the field revolved around manually designed feature extraction and explicit processing techniques, but statistical techniques started to appear in the 1990s~\cite[p.~15]{computer_vision_history}.
The statistical approach to the problem domain eventually morphed into the field of \textit{machine learning}, where most of the advances are made today~\cite[p.~17]{computer_vision_history}.

In this section, we will start by describing the particular image recognition problem of interest for the our research question, namely \textit{semantic segmentation}.
\Secref{sec:segmentation-metrics} will summarize the metrics used for evaluating the quality of a given image segmentation.
\textit{Convolutional neural networks} (CNNs) have been successfully applied to image segmentation problems~\cite[p.~1]{image_recognition}, and will be described in~\secref{sec:cnn}.
State-of-the-art CNN architectures for image segmentation will be listed in~\secref{sec:state-of-the-art}.
