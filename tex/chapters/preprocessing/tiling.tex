Given a specific geographic region, defined by the extent of the cadastral plot, we must retrieve the raster which entirely covers the region of interest.
The simplest approach is to calculate the \textit{axis-aligned bounding box} of the plot, the minimum-area enclosing rectangle of the given plot, defined by four points, $(x_{\mathrm{min}}, y_{\mathrm{min}}, x_{\mathrm{max}}, y_{\mathrm{max}})$.
The resulting bounding box of width $w = x_{\mathrm{max}} - x_{\mathrm{min}}$ and height $h = y_{\mathrm{max}} - y_{\mathrm{min}}$ is shown in \figref{fig:cadastral-bbox}.

The edges of the bounding box is by definition oriented parallel to the coordinate axes.
An alternative method is to calculate the \textit{arbitrarily oriented minimum bounding box} (AOMBB), a rectangle rotated by $\phi$ degrees w.r.t. the $x$-axis, as shown in \figref{fig:rotated-bbox}.

While AOMBB results in a region with less superfluous raster data, it requires warping of the original raw raster when $\phi \not\in \{ \SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{90}{\degree}, \SI{180}{\degree}, \SI{270}{\degree} \}$.
This requires data interpolation of the original raster data due to the rotation of the coordinate system, and may introduce artifacts in the warped raster data without careful parameter tuning.
AOMBB is therefore not a viable approach during the preprocessing stage, and we will therefore use axis-aligned minimum bounding boxes instead, from now on simply referred to as \textit{bounding boxes}.

Calculating bounding boxes for the cadastral plots in our data sets will yield rectangles of variable dimensions.
