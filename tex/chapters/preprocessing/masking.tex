    The same polygon discretized to a raster grid using two different techniques.
    In the left figure, all pixels being \textit{touched} by the interior of the polygon
    are considered a part of the polygon, while in the left figure, only pixels
    entirely \textit{contained} within the interior are considered being part
    of the polygon.
