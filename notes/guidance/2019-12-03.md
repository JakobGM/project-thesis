## Answers

* Seems to be approximately correct amount of detail in state-of-the-art, but it is important that I do not only write about classification architectures.
* SegCaps architecture can be something to investigate on the Master's thesis.
* The spikes in the training plot should be investigated. Channel dropout from "cnn-dropout-order" citation possible remedy?
* I should try to finish before the original deadline, but it is OK to ask for 1 week extension if I can't manage it.
* When I am *completely* finished with a chapter, I should submit it to Erlend for a thorough review.
* Use of colors in plots, figures, and passive/active voice should not be a large worry. The most important aspect is that everything should be understandable.
* Get started on experimentation as soon as possible.
* Do not write too much on optimization, it is a common "trap".
