# Guidance session 4

## TODO this upcoming week

* Get pretty far finding rasterized polygons.
* The master thesis will involve finding vectorized polygons directly.
* Re-implement a "state-of-the-art" model and compare my implementation with the published results.
* The thesis will involve...
  * A literary study which refers to different techniques that have been successfully applied to the problem at hand.
  * One of these methods will be implemented.
* Start writing about the dataset and different techniques used in academia.
* Write on Slack when I decide which model to re-implement.
* Test pre-trained segmentation model on my dataset, and post results on Slack.
