# Guidance session 8

## Session Notes

* The research question needs to be well defined and concise. Add it to the introduction.
* I should have a "state-of-the-art" chapter where I summarize all the methods used in the literature.
* I can mention that this project thesis is the ground work for my master's thesis.
