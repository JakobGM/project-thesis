# Guidance session 2

## Agenda

* [Data available in Trondheim](http://folk.ntnu.no/jakobgm/trondheim_data.html).
* [Course selection](https://gist.github.com/JakobGM/1aebb3e46af60bfe2e9d3421c9e52111).

## Done since last time

* Access to "Digitalt Norge" gotten from the Geomatics department at NTNU.
* Access to closed polygon data for all roof surfaces in Trondheim municipality.

## Possible tasks going forwards

* Classify pixels as building vs. non-building as a binary 0/1 problem.
* Edge detection along the lines of OpenCV.

## Problems encountered so far

* Orthophoto misalignment relative to the other data.

## Meeting notes

* We might want to add RGB orthophoto as an additional layer later in the process.
* Transform orthophoto to "real orthophoto" by using LiDAR data.
  * Problem: different years and different season.
* Segmentation map.
* Image segmentation.
* GAN could be used for orthophoto -> true orthophoto.

## Tasks for next time

* Complete gathering of data
* Implement the data pipeline.
* Find relevant research articles.
* Share sample sizes of the data sets on Slack.
* Share relevant articles on Slack.
